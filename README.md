### Strings

1. Choose a standard of `$name = 'john';` or `$name = "john";`
2. you can also store number` $name = '7';`
3. Now if you want to use single quotes between a string
```php
$message = 'It's a lovely day today';
```
4. To solve issue use  '\' which tell php we should not consider next ' as literal string
```php
echo $message = 'It\'s a lovely day today';
```

5. Alternative you can use double quotes "
```php
echo $message = "It's a lovely day today";
```

6. Same issue if you have double quotes
```php
$message = "He said "learning PHP is great";
```

7. 
```php
echo $message = "He said \"learning PHP is great\"";
```


8. You can fix it by using ' instead
```php
echo $message = "He said 'learning PHP is great'";
```
9. You should usually use save coding standard, yet, if it makes things easier then use both.
```php
$name = 'john';

$message = $name . ' said "learning PHP is great".';

echo $message;
```

10. another situation we use both is when we use a link tag.

11. will get error
```php
    echo "<a href="https://www.google.com/">Link</a>";
```

12. Works but does not looks clean.
```php
echo "<a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Link</a>";
```
13. With both different quotes types lookes better
```php
echo '<a href="https://www.google.com">Link</a>';
```
